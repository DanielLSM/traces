# So we are going to solve the task packaging problem as a bin packaging problem.
# Each day is a bin and we can compute Ã  priori all the bins and their limits in man-hours
# for A checks is trivial and we keep assigining until limits are reached
# for C checks, when a C check starts, bins are created each day, then ordered
# the order of the bins is: fill the ones with least amount of aircrafts assigned first
